# Budget_me -  Expense Tracker (Python Project)

A beginner-friendly Python project that tracks daily expenses through the command line and saves them automatically to a file.  
This project was built to practice **Python basics, file handling, and clean program design** while creating something practical and easy to use.



## Project Overview

This is a simple **command-line expense tracker** that lets users record daily expenses, view them, and calculate total spending.  
All expenses are automatically saved to a local text file so you donâ€™t lose your data when you close the program.

## Features

- Add new expenses (description + amount)  
- View all recorded expenses  
- View total spending  
- Automatically save data to a file (`expenses.txt`)  
- Simple and beginner-friendly interface

## ðŸš€ Next Steps / Future Improvements

Here are a few features I plan to add next:

- ðŸ“… Add a date to each expense  
- ðŸ’¾ Export expenses to a CSV file  
- ðŸ“Š Show total spent by day or category  
- ðŸ’» Add a simple GUI version using Tkinter or Streamlit  

These will make the project more advanced as I continue learning.
